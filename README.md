## SIM Game
Sim is a two-player game where players take rounds to highlight lines connecting dots in a hexagon with their color. Whoever forms a triangle with their color first loses the game. This game can't end in a tie.

The game was made using Unity. It's single-player, and the user competes against an AI that utilizes a min-max algorithm to compete with the player. The difficulty can be adjusted.

The play functionality is implemented, but the game's UI and settings menu are still a work-in-progress. Here is a sneak peak of the game play:
